                In early 2002, after identifying the growing demand for studies in Information Technology, the University decided to start the MCA course in the Computer Centre. A three-year (six-semester) regular MCA program was launched in 2002, utilizing the infrastructure of the Computer Centre, under the name "MCA Study Centre."      
            </p>
            <p align="justify" class="lead">
                This study center was later transformed into a regular postgraduate department and renamed the "University Department of Computer Applications." Currently, UDCA continues to conduct the MCA course, providing quality education in the field of computer applications.
